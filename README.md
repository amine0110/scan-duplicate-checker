![Scan Duplicate Checker Logo](assets/cover.png)

Scan Duplicate Checker is a powerful tool designed to help medical professionals and researchers identify duplicate medical scans quickly and efficiently. Whether you're managing a large database of medical images or comparing individual scans, our application streamlines the process of detecting duplicates.

## Features

- **Folder Analysis**: Scan entire directories to find duplicate images.
- **One-to-One Comparison**: Compare two specific scans for similarity.
- **Multiple Format Support**: Works with various medical image formats including DICOM, NIfTI, and NRRD.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical interface for both technical and non-technical users.

## Getting Started

We offer two ways to get started with Scan Duplicate Checker:

1. **For Users**: If you're looking to use the application without diving into the code, follow our [No-Developer Guidelines](guidelines/no-developer.md).

2. **For Developers**: If you want to run the application from source or contribute to the project, check out our [Developer Guidelines](guidelines/developer.md).

## How It Works

Scan Duplicate Checker uses advanced image processing algorithms to compare medical scans. It analyzes the content and metadata of the images to determine if they are duplicates, even if they've been slightly modified or saved in different formats.
